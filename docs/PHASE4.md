# ARGUS — Phase 4: Dashboard, Sessions, Public Landing, Chatbot, Multimodal

**Status:** 🟡 Sprint 4.1 code-complete, not yet live-verified. Sprints 4.2–4.6 not started. Every
checkbox below is ⏳ until its sprint is code-complete (🟡) and then confirmed against the live
Render + Vercel app (✅), per the project's status-marks rule. This file is the execution plan,
not a status claim.
**Timeline:** Weeks 11–13 (blueprint), realistically paced across the six sub-sprints below.
**SDLC Stages:** UI/UX Design → Realtime Integration → Public Surface → Re-deploy
**Prerequisite:** Phase 3 closed and live-verified (✅ 3a 2026-07-08, 3b 2026-07-09). Confirmed
unblocked.

## In plain terms (the 30-second version)

Everything built through Phase 3 works, but you can only see it by calling the API directly or
reading raw JSON — there's no dashboard, no way to browse past research sessions, and no public
page for someone who isn't already logged in. Phase 4 makes the system visible:

1. **A live health view.** Circuit breaker states and security events, updating in real time,
   not something you'd have to SSH in or query Supabase directly to see.
2. **A session history.** Every past research run, with a visual step-by-step replay of what
   each agent did (the Debug Diary's frontend — data's been ready since Sprint 3a.5).
3. **A cleaner report view.** The raw Sources/Confidence sections move behind a "show details"
   toggle; most users just see a clean answer and a confidence badge.
4. **A public front door.** Today the root URL force-redirects straight to a login wall. Phase 4
   adds an actual landing page — what ARGUS is, how it works, who built it — plus Google sign-in
   so a recruiter can try it without an email/password flow.
5. **(Sprint 4.5+) A public chatbot and multimodal document reading**, each gated behind its own
   threat-model planning pass, same discipline Web Scout (3b) went through before it was built.

**What Phase 4 deliberately does NOT include:** an admin role, a global "every user's traffic"
view, a world map, or a maintenance kill-switch. `docs/BLUEPRINT.md`'s original Phase 4 sketch
assumed those; they move to an explicitly-named **Phase 4b**, not scheduled. Full reasoning in
`docs/ADR-018.md` Part 3. Building a read-only per-user dashboard first, on RLS that already
exists, ships real value without inventing a role system this project doesn't need yet.

## Sprint plan

### Sprint 4.1 — Backend hardening + honest-docs split

**Status:** 🟡 Code-complete 2026-07-09, not yet live-verified. `backend` `py_compile` clean
across every touched file.

**What was built:**
- `circuit_breaker.py` — new `hf_embedding_breaker`, deliberately separate from `hf_breaker`
  (which guards the prompt-injection classifier). Same 5-fail/120s-window/60s-recovery tuning as
  every other breaker. See `docs/ADR-018.md` Part 2 for why the two HF breakers stay separate.
- `document_processor.py` — `_hf_embedding_once()` now detects HF's cold-start
  `{"error": "..."}` 200-body (previously only `embed_query` checked for this; `embed_chunks`
  had no validation at all — BACKLOG Item 6). `_hf_embedding_with_retry()` does one retry
  *inside* the function that gets passed to the breaker, so a real outage counts as one breaker
  failure, not two. Per-attempt HTTP timeout dropped 60s → 30s.
- `main.py` — `CircuitBreakerOpen` now caught explicitly in both the upload handler and
  `/research`, returned as a clean `503` with a `retry_in_s`-derived hint instead of an
  uncaught exception or a generic `500`. New `hf_embedding` entry in
  `/health/circuit-breakers`. New `GET /research` endpoint: lists the caller's own sessions
  (`?collection_id=&limit=&offset=`, clamped 1–50), metadata only (`id, collection_id, query,
  status, created_at`), no `report` field — the input the Sprint 4.3 sessions list needs.
- `llm_json.py` — new `call_reasoning_json()` + `ReasoningTruncated`. One function now owns
  every Groq reasoning-model call across `orchestrator.py`, `synthesizer.py`, and `critic.py`:
  checks `finish_reason`, retries once at a lower `reasoning_effort` on truncation, raises a
  typed error if the retry also truncates. Each agent's `max_tokens`/`reasoning_effort` and
  fail-open `except` block are unchanged — this is a drop-in replacement for the raw
  `client.chat.completions.create()` call each agent used to make directly, not a behavior
  change on the happy path. Full story (three independent recurrences of this exact bug,
  across three agents, finally consolidated): `docs/ADR-018.md` Part 1.
- `reporter.py` — the "web search unavailable" banner now renders right after the answer
  instead of between the Sources list and the Confidence badge (it explains something about how
  the *answer* was produced, not the sources). No-banner output is byte-identical to before.
- `supabase/migrations/009_realtime_security_events.sql` — idempotently publishes
  `security_events` to Supabase Realtime so Sprint 4.2's live events feed can subscribe instead
  of polling. No new RLS policy needed — migration 004's existing "own security events" SELECT
  policy is what Realtime evaluates per subscriber.
- Docs: this file, `docs/ADR-018.md` (new), `docs/BLUEPRINT.md` (breaker/degradation table,
  database schema table, API surface, Phase 4/4b roadmap split), `docs/ROADMAP.md` (Phase 4
  section rewritten, owner notes closed/graduated, n8n note added), `docs/ADVERSARIAL-TESTS.md`
  (GATE-18 through GATE-22 stubs), `docs/BACKLOG.md` (Item 6 closed, Item 3 scheduled into 4.4).

**Verify live (manual steps, Clint's):**
1. Paste `supabase/migrations/009_realtime_security_events.sql` into the Supabase SQL editor.
   Confirm via Database → Publications that `security_events` is now listed under
   `supabase_realtime`.
2. `git push` — Render redeploys the backend.
3. Normal research query → confirm the report renders exactly as before (banner reorder should
   be invisible on the no-banner path).
4. `GET /research?limit=5` (with a valid Bearer token, e.g. via the browser devtools Network
   tab after a login) → confirm it returns an array of your own sessions, no `report` field.
5. **GATE-22** — temporarily set `HF_TOKEN` to an invalid value on Render, run a query, confirm
   a clean `503` (not a `500` or a hang) with a retry-time hint, and that `/health/circuit-
   breakers` shows `hf_embedding` as `open`. Restore the real `HF_TOKEN`, confirm it recovers to
   `closed` after the next successful call.
6. GATE-18/19 need Sprint 4.3's UI (or a manual `curl` with two accounts) to fully exercise —
   record what's checkable now, finish the rest when the sessions list ships.

### Sprint 4.2 — Theme system + frontend foundation + SOC page

**Status:** ⏳ Not started.

Planned: dark/light/system theme toggle (CSS-variable tokens, nonce'd inline init script to
avoid flash-of-wrong-theme); `frontend/utils/api.ts` shared fetch helper; dashboard nav layout;
`/dashboard/soc` — breaker health cards (poll `/health/circuit-breakers`) + a live
`security_events` feed via Supabase Realtime (migration 009 makes this possible). Full detail in
the approved planning doc.

---

### Sprint 4.3 — Sessions, timeline, report UX, cancel

**Status:** ⏳ Not started.

Planned: `/dashboard/sessions` list (consumes Sprint 4.1's `GET /research`) + deep-linkable
`/dashboard/sessions/[id]` detail with an `ExecutionTimeline` (consumes `/research/{id}/trace`,
live since Sprint 3a.5); Sources/Confidence moved behind a "show details" toggle; upload/research
cancel support (`AbortController` + backend `CancelledError` cleanup); in-browser PDF preview
before a file is committed to a collection.

---

### Sprint 4.4 — Public landing + Google sign-in + usage limits

**Status:** ⏳ Not started.

Planned: `/` becomes a public marketing page (today it force-redirects to `/dashboard`); Google
OAuth via Supabase Auth; new `usage_limits` table, owner-editable in Supabase Studio, visible in
the UI as a usage meter. Closes BACKLOG Item 3.

---

### Sprint 4.5 — Project Q&A chatbot + rate limiting

**Status:** ⏳ Not started. Own threat-model planning pass required before build — a public,
unauthenticated LLM endpoint is a new attack surface and a new cost surface. Locked shape so far:
Gemini via raw `httpx` REST from a separate Google Cloud project (quota isolation), grounded on a
static curated project summary (not live document retrieval), per-IP sliding-window limit + a
persisted global daily cap, regex + trust-level injection posture reused from the existing guard.

---

### Sprint 4.6 — Multimodal PDF ingestion + Report Generation

**Status:** ⏳ Not started. Own threat-model planning pass required before build — image-borne
prompt injection is a currently-uncovered channel (PyMuPDF is text-only today; see BACKLOG
Item 4). Two locked shapes so far: vision captioning via Groq Llama 4 Scout with captions scanned
by the same regex + a new `image_derived` trust level; a separate "Generate report" flow with a
domain-tailored template, preview-before-download, and `.docx`/PDF export, metered by
`usage_limits`.

---

## Phase 4b — parking lot, not scheduled

Everything in `docs/BLUEPRINT.md`'s original Phase 4 sketch that needs an admin role or a table
that doesn't exist: world map, global cross-user request feed (`request_log`), IP intelligence
panel, `admin_settings` maintenance kill-switch, `circuit_breaker_log` history table, an AI
session summarizer, and the `ip-api.com` breaker (nothing calls that service until this lands).
Full reasoning for the split: `docs/ADR-018.md` Part 3.
